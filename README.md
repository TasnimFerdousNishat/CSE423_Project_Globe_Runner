<h2 id ="1"> Description </h2>
The main ball represents the player moving on a road. Its goal is to collect balls of the same color to increase the score. However, if it hits a ball of a different color, the game ends.
<br>
The game doesn't have a limit, so as the score goes up, the levels become more challenging. The difficulty depends on how many balls there are, whether they are the same color or different.
Additionally, there are moving walls that change the color of the main ball when it passes through them.
<br>
There are different screens for starting, pausing, winning, continuing, and ending the game.
